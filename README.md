## Arc-flow Vector Packing Solver (VPSolver)

Copyright (C) 2013-2022, Filipe Brandão <fdabrandao@gmail.com>

---
[VPSolver](https://github.com/fdabrandao/vpsolver) is a multiple-choice vector packing solver based on an arc-flow formulation with graph compression (see, e.g., [\[1\]](#references)). VPSolver generates very strong models (equivalent to Gilmore and Gomory's) that can be solved using general-purpose mixed-integer programming
solvers such as Gurobi and GLPK (see, e.g., [\[2\]](#references) and [\[3\]](#references)). VPSolver does not explicitly require any MIP solver in particular, though a good  MIP solver may be necessary for solving large models.

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/fdabrandao0236/vpsolver/_apis/build/status/fdabrandao.vpsolver?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/fdabrandao0236/vpsolver/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

For modelling other problems easily, VPSolver includes a [Python API](https://github.com/fdabrandao/vpsolver/wiki/Python-API), a modelling toolbox ([PyMPL](https://github.com/fdabrandao/pympl/)), and a [Web App](#vpsolver-web-app). VPSolver has been successfully compiled and run on Linux, macOS, and Windows. VPSolver can also be used in [Docker containers](#docker).

For more details, please refer to the [project wiki](https://github.com/fdabrandao/vpsolver/wiki) or to the [manual](https://github.com/fdabrandao/vpsolver/tree/master/docs/vpsolver_manual.pdf).

#### Repositories
* Project Homepage: <http://vpsolver.fdabrandao.pt>
* GiHub repository: <https://github.com/fdabrandao/vpsolver>
* BitBucket repository: <https://bitbucket.org/fdabrandao/vpsolver>
* Docker repository: <https://hub.docker.com/r/fdabrandao/vpsolver>
* PyPI repository: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvpsolver>

## Requirements
#### Mandatory

- To use vpsolver scripts for various solvers:
  * MIP solver: Gurobi, CPLEX, GLPK, COIN-OR, SCIP, lp_solve, ...
  * UNIX-like operating system or a UNIX-like environment such as [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) on Windows
  * `g++`, `clang`, or `Visual Studio`; `cmake >= 3.3`; `bash >= 3.0`

- To build the vpsolver executable linked to Gurobi:
  * `gurobi`
  * `cmake >= 3.3`

#### Optional
For the [Python API](https://github.com/fdabrandao/vpsolver/wiki/Python-API) and Web App:

* `python-2.7` or `python-3.x`
* `python-pip`
* `python-dev`
* `glpk-utils`
 
#### Platforms
It has been successfully compiled and run on the following platforms:

* **Linux**
* **macOS**
* **Windows** (note that vpsolver scripts require bash)

## Setup
Without the python interface: 

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build . --config Release
```
Note: In order to compile the components that require Gurobi, you need to have set the environment variable `GUROBI_HOME` or specify the location of the Gurobi installation in the third step:
- Linux: `cmake .. -DGUROBI_DIR=/opt/gurobi952/linux64/`
- macOS: `cmake .. -DGUROBI_DIR=/Library/gurobi952/macos_universal2/`
- Windows: `cmake .. -DGUROBI_DIR=C:\\gurobi952\\win64`

With the python interface: 

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install . --upgrade
$ cd examples; py.test -v --cov pyvpsolver
```
Or simply install from the [repository](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvpsolver):

```
$ pip install pyvpsolver
```

## Python interface

The python interface is fully compatible with both python 2 and 3. 

Jupyter Notebooks for a quick introduction:

* [Simple VBP example](https://github.com/fdabrandao/vpsolver/blob/master/examples/notebooks/example_vbp.ipynb)
* [Simple MVP example](https://github.com/fdabrandao/vpsolver/blob/master/examples/notebooks/example_mvp.ipynb)

## Docker

### Docker Setup

Docker is an open platform for building, shipping and running applications. Docker allows VPSolver to run on a large variety of platforms with very little effort.

Install Docker [[Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/installation/)].

Option 1: simply `pull` VPSolver from Docker repository (without building):

```bash
$ docker pull fdabrandao/vpsolver
```

Option 2: `clone` VPSolver and `build` locally:

```bash 
$ git clone https://github.com/fdabrandao/vpsolver.git vpsolver
$ docker build -t fdabrandao/vpsolver vpsolver
```

### Usage
Directly using the command line interface:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it fdabrandao/vpsolver bash
root@55d14f6b6f32:~# source venv2.7/bin/activate # load a virtualenv
(venv2.7)root@55d14f6b6f32:~# python examples/vpsolver/example_vbp.py
...
```

or through the VPSolver Web App (example URL: `http://172.17.0.60:5555/`):

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it -p 5555 fdabrandao/vpsolver
